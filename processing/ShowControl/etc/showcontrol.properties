# Each DMX universe (of which there are three, for three arms) is addressed as follows:
#     * 1-108 are cubes 1-36 R,G,B interleaved (108)
#     * 109-117 are control cubes (9)
#     * 118-141 are flame effects 1-8 on arms A, B, C (24)
#     * 142-144 are hi-pressure valves on arms A,B,C (3)
#     * 145 is the central poofer (1)
#     * 146 is the tornado fan (1)
#     * 147 is the tornado fuel (wired so that it cannot open the valve if the fan is not running) (1) 
# XXX i'm assuming that the wiki docs start counting at 1 and the code starts counting at 0, but could someone else confirm that?
