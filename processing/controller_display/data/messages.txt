I don't know which came first, shitty rave music or the drugs...
Oh, for crying out loud, just torch the bastard and we're outta here!
Honour thy error as a hidden intention
Is this going to make my ass explode?
Don't be afraid of things because they're easy to do
Welcome to the Future! We're glad you made it!
Mute and continue
Are those lights the art, or am I on mushrooms?
Too bad they don't have real monkeys here.
What are the sections sections of? Imagine a caterpillar moving
Burning man is so surreal that I can't tell if something is real or it's my drugs.
Would you shut the fuck up? You're interfering with the surreality of my experience! 
Consider transitions
Authenticity costs extra.
What could possibly go wrong?
If you push something hard enough, it will fall over.
They say we're stubborn, they say we're closed-minded, but I say there's nothing closed-minded about shunning ideas that make you scared and uncomfortable.
Faced with a choice, do both
Make it more sensual
This can only end in awesomeness.
Burning Man is the Special Olympics of art.
This is the place to be right now.
Infinitesimal gradations
CAN'T SLEEP, CLOWNS WILL EAT ME !!!
We are sharing a moment in time and we smile.
Everything you take to Burning Man, including yourself, will never be the same
Turn it upside down
Who am us, anyway?
Don't mellow my harsh you fucking hippie!
A week of freedom out in the desert, naked women, getting back to your primal nature, naked women, people doing art, naked women....
It was already burning when I got here.
Be less critical
Namaste, motherfuckers!
Burning Man makes up for what society did to you the rest of the year
Discover the recipes you are using and abandon them
Disciplined self-indulgence
Ask your body
Only a part, not the whole
Don't be frightened to display your talents
Cascades
What would your closest friend do?
Accept advice
Discard an axiom
