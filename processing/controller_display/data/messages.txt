Oh, for crying out loud, just torch the bastard and we're outta here!
Is this going to make my ass explode?
Welcome to the Future! We're glad you made it!
Are those lights the art, or am I on mushrooms?
Too bad they don't have real monkeys here.
I'm craving licorice. I think I'm going wandering until I find a camp that has some. 
Burning man is so surreal that I cannot tell if something is real or it's my drugs.
Would you shut the fuck up? You're interfering with the surreality of my experience! 
Authenticity costs extra.
What could possibly go wrong?
If you push something hard enough, it will fall over.
They say we're stubborn, they say we're closed-minded, but I say there's nothing closed-minded about shunning ideas that make you scared and uncomfortable.
This can only end in awesomeness.
Burning Man is the Special Olympics of art.
It takes a lot to shock a bunch of jaded fags from San Francisco, but standing on top of an RV and shaving your snatch pretty much does the trick.
CAN'T SLEEP, CLOWNS WILL EAT ME !!!
Everything you take to Burning Man, including yourself, will never be the same
Who am us, anyway?

Don't mellow my harsh you fucking hippie!
A week of freedom out in the desert, naked women, getting back to your primal nature, naked women, people doing art, naked women....
