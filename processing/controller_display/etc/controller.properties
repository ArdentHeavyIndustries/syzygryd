# [0=A, 1=B, 2=C]
# this value is ignored if the hostname is "controller1", "controller2", or "controller3"
# in that case, the panel index is set based on the hostname
#panelIndex=0

# location of the sequencer
# either an IP address or hostname
# "localhost" is what you want for all local testing
#sequencerHost=10.10.10.10

# do we require the switcher to start (using /timeRemaining messages)
# otherwise, the sequencer by itself is adequate (using /sync messages)

# in test mode, we randomly emulate touchscreen/mouse presses
#testMode=false
# set to a non-zero value to replicate a past run.  otherwise, 0 is fine, which will seed based on the current time
