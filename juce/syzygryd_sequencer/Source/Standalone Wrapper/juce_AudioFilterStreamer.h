    Wraps an AudioFilterStreamer in an AudioDeviceManager to make it easy to
    create a standalone filter.

    This simply acts as a singleton AudioDeviceManager, which continuously
    streams audio from the filter you give it with the setFilter() method.

    To use it, simply create an instance of it (or use getInstance() if you're
    using it as a singleton), initialise it like you would a normal
    AudioDeviceManager, and call setFilter() to start it running your plugin.
